# Who am I?

I am a entrepreneur and a software developer with six years of experience on software development, mostly of that using .NET. I've worked for 3 years on Vox Game Studio and I'm currently at Dell Technologies for one year and a half, focused on Contact Center segment working with B2B and B2C projects.

Mubbi.com.br is my first attempt at entrepreneurship. I joined as a partner by invitation of Pedro Monego and I'm currently in charge of helping developing our digital marketing, fix some issues at our legacy website and create the new version focused on go to the azure cloud.

At Vox Game Studio I've worked in the entire Alphabeta project using Unity3D. It is a financial project with the intuit of teaching financial market to universities. I designed most of the system architecture, dealing with security, payments, financial calculations and memory handling. This project was fully developed with .NET Framework with the MonoBehavior framework from Unity.

On Dell I work in an application that do automated regression tests in Dell interactive voice response system. Also as a side project, I developed a tool for the sales representatives that automatically verifies if a customer belongs to their segment, in the past they had to check four to five different systems and check if different conditions were met in order to be able to serve the customer. All of this projects were using the Pivotal Cloud Service and the main technologies I've worked in here were .NET Core, Javascript, Angular, Blazor and Flutter.

Besides that, I love programming and I consider myself a technology enthusiast. I aim to become a MVP from Microsoft as a personal goal.

On my free time I like to help some friends on development and recently I started a community of developers to share knowledge and help those who want to know how to get started in the world of development. The name is PampaDevs and our org GitHub is https://github.com/Pampa-Devs. You will find some tutorials (and maybe by the time you read this a completed discord bot using NodeJS).

I already 'played' with a lot of frameworks, but the ones I have experience are: .NET, NodeJS, Angular, Unity3D. I'm also quite experienced in Git, GitLab ci-cd, SOLID and clean code practices, TDD and BDD.

obs: I know how to make coffee.
